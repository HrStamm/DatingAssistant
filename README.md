# DatingAssistant ðŸ’•  

This repository contains the code for **DatingAssistant**, a summer side project experimenting with AI-powered web applications, frontend development in Next.js, and coding with AI agents.

**Author:** Valdemar Stamm Kristensen  
**Project type:** Side project (summer 2025)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

DatingAssistant is a Next.js web application designed to give users a fun little edge in online dating. The app combines AI-powered text generation with a modern interface to help users:

- Generate personalized chat responses in different tones (flirty, funny, romantic, casual), the point was that you write your matches message from a dating app like Tinder or Hinge, and then you get a good response based on the tone chosen if unsure what to write back.  
- Optimize dating profiles (currently a placeholder, image recognition LLM not yet integrated). Here the point was to upload a picture of your profile from a dating app and it could give you advice, such as "smile more in picture 2" or "have a picture with friends so you seem more social".  

The project was mainly created as an exploration of modern web technologies, AI integration (LLM wrappers), and "coding with AI agents" such as GitHub Copilot Agent mode (Claude Sonnet 4).

## ðŸ“– What I Learned  

This project was my sandbox for exploring:  
- **Modern React Patterns** â€“ Context, hooks, and avoiding component sprawl  
- **AI Integration** â€“ Prompting GPT, balancing ease and complexity  
- **Coding with AI Agents** â€“ Using Copilot as a pair programming assistant  
- **User Experience Design** â€“ Focusing on usability and smooth interactions  
- **The Art of "Good Enough"** â€“ Shipping a working project instead of chasing perfection
